# Problem Statement

Engineers, students, and hobbyists frequently encounter challenges when
collaborating on circuit design and analysis in real-time. Existing circuit
simulation tools lack collaborative features, making it difficult for multiple users
to work together effectively. The lack of synchronization and a user-friendly interface hinders productive collaboration. There is a need for a collaborative
circuit simulator that overcomes these limitations.

# Proposed Solution

Develop a real-time collaborative circuit simulator using Socket.io, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and
TypeScript. This platform will allow multiple users to design, modify, and simulate electronic
circuits simultaneously in a shared workspace. Key features include real-time
synchronization, an intuitive user interface, and circuit simulation.
